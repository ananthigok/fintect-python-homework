### Idea for the company (or project) come about is explained here 
    One of the class activities in the first week of the Bootcamp was to explore Fin Tech in the future and when discussing that at home with family on the next day, my idea was to develop a bot which could act as a Personal Finance Virtaul Assistant for Digital Banking and while googling for the week 1 case study, came across this organisation in Canada and selected that for case study 

## Funding of the Company
    Finn AI is a venture-backed with investments by Yaletown Partners, Flying Fish Partners. BDC Capital, and 1843 Capital etc with a total of 10 investors.

    Finn AI has raised a total of $13.9M in funding over 4 rounds.

## Business Activities:

### Challenge or the problem that is been faced and to be solved could be listed below

    Chatbots may respond to questions like “What is my balance?” or “When is my bill due?” They also typically pose the
    same questions to all customers regardless of their situation. If an interaction demands more complexity or if the user asks the question not exactly the way the chatbot expected (such as “how much cash do I have” vs. “what is my balance”), customers may be out of luck, leaving them to frantically type or say “agent” to escalate their inquiry. 

    In addition, the chatbot capabilities may not be easily discoverable, which contributes to customer frustrations.

    This only means the AI dictionary needs to be strengthened to handle these challenges in future in such a way that human intervention still could be reduced 

### Company's intended customerand the market size of this set of customers

    Finn AI works with banks to help their users improve their financial well-being and also help banks move 
    up the value chain

    There’s lots of information about how you’re spending money, where you’re spending money, where you might be having trouble with your money, and there’s lots of ways to serve that data back to people in a proactive way, so they can avoid certain situations or optimize their finances. 

    But the principle will be that you have to provide a much more proactive and predictive experience for customers when you’re using their data and that can play out in lots of different ways.
