## Instructions

### 1 - Sentiment Analysis

Using the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and created a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.

The following questions were answered using descriptive satistics:

> Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
>
> Which coin had the highest negative score?
>
> Which coin had the highest positive score?



### 2 - Natural Language Processing

In this section, NLTK and Python was used to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for both coins. 

#### Tokenized with the below points

1. Lowercased each word.
2. Removed punctuation.
3. Removed stop words.

#### N-grams

Next, looked at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

1. Used NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.
2. Listed the top 10 words for each coin.

#### Word Clouds

Finally, generated word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.
