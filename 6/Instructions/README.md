## Instructions

### Rental Analysis

The first step to building the dashboard was to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook. Then a dashboard code and used with Panel was attempted to create the final layout. Tasks title are as listed below

#### Dwelling Types Per Year

calculate the number of dwelling types per year and visualize the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.

#### Average Monthly Shelter Costs in Toronto Per Year

To visualize the average monthly shelter costs per year to understand rental income trends over time better. and also to visualize the average (mean) shelter cost for owned and rented dwellings per year and visualize it as line charts.


#### Average House Value per Year


1. Calculated the mean `average_house_value` for each year.

2. Visualized the `average_house_value` per year as a line chart.


#### Average Prices By Neighbourhood

#### Number of Dwelling Types per Year

#### Top 10 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods

#### Neighbourhood Map

### Dashboard

The Panel library was used to build an interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations.
